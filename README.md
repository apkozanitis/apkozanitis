## Hey there!  My name is Apostolos Kozanitis 👋

I graduated from my Master's degree in engineering on March 2025 and I am passionate about data and analytics. 
I'm actively working on multiple data analytics projects using SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. Feel free to explore my repositories to see my work in action!
